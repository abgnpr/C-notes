# Structure

In real world programming we have to deal with collections of data or structured information which have different attributes. For example, there various items on an e-commerce website and each item has a name, price, brand, rating, comments etc. These attributes have different data types, for instance: name is string, price may be float or int. To group these data pieces into a collection or structure, C provides a data type called `struct`.

A `struct` clubs together small atomic data items (both basic and user-defined types) under one large umbrella object. The small data items are then called members of that `struct`.

Formally

A struct is a type consisting of a sequence of members of various data types whose storage is allocated in an ordered sequence.
